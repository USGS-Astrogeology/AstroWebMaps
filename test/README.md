# Sample code

To see this test page in action, start an HTTP server from the root directory
of this repository, then open this `test/index.html` page.

If you have Python(3) at hand, you can simply run its built-in server,
```bash
$ python -m http.server --directory AstroWebMaps
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
...
```
, and you are good to visit http://localhost:8000/test/.
